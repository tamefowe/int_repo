        annual property value growth (appreciation 2%)
How much do you expect the value of the property to increase per year?
For example, if the property is worth $100,000 today and you think next year
        it will be worth $103,000, enter 3%. Be sure to use a conservative number that
accounts for both the ups and downs in the market.
Loan Details

Loan amount x% of purchase price and y% down payment (x+y=100)
interest rate (%)

Often when you take out a loan, you will pay "points" (aka: fees) on the loan.
One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. For example, a $100,000 loan with
2 points would be $2,000. Note: this is most common with hard money lenders.

        Maintenance, vacancy, capital expenditures, and management fees are expressed
as percentages of gross monthly income.

Repair & maintenance
All properties require ongoing maintenance when things break (and with tenants - they will).
This number is usually expressed as a percentage of the rent. Although repairs will depend
on numerous factors such as the location and age of the property; typical repair costs tend
to be between 5-15% of the gross monthly rent.
Vacancy
        Vacancy rate is the cost of the property sitting empty due to tenant turnover.
This number can vary depending on the area, so consult with a local property manager or
landlord as to the local norms. Typical vacancy rates are between 3%-10% of
        the gross monthly rent, but again, that can depend on the area.
Capital Expenditures
CapEx, short for Capital Expenditures, are the large less-than-frequent improvements done to
a property such as roofs, parking lots, siding, or appliances. CapEx will depend on numerous
        factors such as property type, the location of the property, and the age of the property.
Management Fees
How much does a local property manager charge to manage the property each month? This number
is usually expressed as a percentage. This rate may differ based on location and property type,
but typical rates hover between 7-12% of the Gross Monthly Rent.
Electricity
        Gas
