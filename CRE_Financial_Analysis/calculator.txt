rule of thumb for expense %

4 units exp% = 25% of effective gross income
5-20 units exp% = 30-35%
20-50 units exp% = 35-45%
50-100+ units exp% = 45-55% 

Know
deal under market?
can rent be increased?
possible creating financing?

4 things to become an expert in your sub-market
1. price/unit (price/ sqft if commercial space)
2. cap rate for the market
3. market rents (for 1-2-3 bedroom apt units)
4. expenses/unit (for B and C-class apts)
